Here, I present a general overview of some weather radar applications that I think are interesting. Some of the more feature-rich options, like AWIPS or the Gibson Ridge suite, are aimed at professionals and thus are not often mentioned when the question "which radar program should I use?" comes up. The current analysis is limited, but I plan on adding more in-depth feature explanations to each piece of software in the future. Platform support and pricing models are listed up-front, since they're the most important metric when it comes to actually deciding to use a piece of software. Other data will be added piecemeal as I continue to refine this list.
