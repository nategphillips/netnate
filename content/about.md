Hello, I'm Nathan - a Ph.D. student in aerospace engineering at Texas A&M University.
My graduate research involves the application of laser diagnostics to high-enthalpy hypersonic environments, but I maintain an interest in various fields to avoid pigeonholing myself too much.

Fission research is pretty exciting these days, and I've always had a soft spot for nuclear power, so the renewed development of molten salt and small-scale reactors is nice to see.
I'm also rather optimistic about the future of fusion, especially with all the private endeavors going on now, and I hope we'll actually have a reactor on the grid in 20 years.
High-speed propulsion (ram/scramjets, RDEs, etc.) is another rather neat field, and I'd like to learn more about the state of the art when I have more time.

If it wasn't already obvious from the content of this website, two of my interests include tinkering with Linux and typesetting various things in $\LaTeX$.
A longer-term hobby involves trying to teach myself the concepts behind introductory graduate-level physics (e.g., tensor calculus, differential geometry, gauge theory, etc.), which at least has some overlap with my professional aspirations.
More recently, I've been getting a little into linguistics and language more generally; I'd like to learn Latin, ancient Greek, and Russian at some point.
Calisthenics and running are my exercises of choice to ward off my predisposition for a completely sedentary lifestyle.
Other things I enjoy include playing guitar, browsing Wikipedia, and using Google Earth to explore areas that I'd like to visit eventually.
Despite my slightly ostentatious showcase of all the books in my personal [library](/posts/library), I unfortunately read far less than I should.
