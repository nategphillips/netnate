Hello, I'm Nathan---an aerospace engineering PhD student at Texas A&M University.
My graduate research involves the application of laser diagnostics to high-enthalpy hypersonic environments, but I maintain an interest in various fields to avoid pigeonholing myself too much.

### Professional

Fission research is pretty exciting these days, and I've always had a soft spot for nuclear power, so the renewed development of molten salt and small-scale reactors is nice to see.
I'm also rather optimistic about the future of fusion, especially with all the private capital that seems to be entering the market now, and I hope we'll actually have a reactor on the grid in 20 years.
High-speed propulsion (ram/scramjets, RDEs, etc.) is another neat field, and I'd like to learn more about the state of the art when I have time to do so.

### Personal

If it wasn't already obvious from the content of this website, two of my interests include tinkering with Linux and typesetting various things in $\LaTeX$.
A longer-term hobby involves attempting to teach myself the concepts underpinning graduate-level physics (e.g., tensor calculus, differential geometry, geometric algebra, group theory, gauge theory, etc.), which at least maintains a marginal overlap with my professional aspirations.
Looking back, I should have worked towards a BS in physics rather than engineering, but that ship has sailed.
More recently, I've been delving a little into linguistics and language more generally; studying Latin, ancient Greek, and Russian are on the docket at some point.
Calisthenics and running are my exercises of choice to ward off my predisposition for a completely sedentary lifestyle.
Other things I enjoy include playing guitar, browsing Wikipedia, and using Google Earth to explore areas I think are worth visiting.
Despite my slightly ostentatious showcase of all the books in my personal [library](/posts/library), I read far less than I should.
